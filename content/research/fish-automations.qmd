Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) research and development has rapidly accelerated in recent years throughout NOAA. At the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC), innovative ML-based automations have been developed for [ageing fish](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/scientists-identify-more-efficient-means-determine-age-fish-using-ai-and-near-infrared){target="_blank"} (*e.g.*, red snapper, Atlantic menhaden), [species identification, and tracking](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/increasing-efficiency-video-surveys-artificial-intelligence){target="_blank"} reef fish in underwater survey videos. Fish age is the fundamental parameter used for estimating growth, longevity, mortality, maturity, and reproductive output of specific species stock, while species counts provide estimates of abundance and diversity. All of this information gets feds into stock assessment models to enable science-based fisheries management. These automations have been developed by academic partners at the University of Washington and Mississippi State University in collaboration with SEFSC staff, with the goal of increasing the Center's capacity to process data and the efficiency with which the Center is able to fulfill its mission of providing the scientific advice and data needed to effectively manage the living marine resources of the Southeast Region and Atlantic High Seas.
