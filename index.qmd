*Physical oceanographer by training. Observational oceanographer by practice. <br> 
Applied machine learning researcher and data scientist by happenstance.*

<!-- ##### I am a **data scientist** with the [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/){target="_blank"} [Southeast Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southeast-fisheries-science-center){target="_blank"} (SEFSC) having joined [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/){target="_blank"} in 2021 after more than a decade in academia conducting and supporting oceanographic research. I oversee a multidisciplinary team of marine and computer scientists developing innovative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models for automating assorted SEFSC mission priorities including [species identification](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/increasing-efficiency-video-surveys-artificial-intelligence){target="_blank"}, [fish aging](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/scientists-identify-more-efficient-means-determine-age-fish-using-ai-and-near-infrared){target="_blank"}, and marine mammal detection from aerial drones. I also facilitate cloud migration, transition planning, data governance, and [open science](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/){target="_blank"} initiatives for the SEFSC. -->
