    "text": "Ocean thermodynamic structure (temperature, salinity, and density versus depth) is very challenging to measure continuously all throughout the world’s ocean. Ships are slow and expensive, human scientists get tired and sea sick, and the ocean is, well, rather large. Several thousand autonomous Argo profiling floats deployed all over the world since the late 1990s have provided unparalleled glimpses below the surface into the deep ocean. Yet compared to the size of the ocean, even these data remain sparse.\nOn the other hand, satellites orbiting the planet several times a day are able to measure properties such as ocean temperature in considerably higher spatial and temporal resolution. But satellites are optical instruments, meaning they can only “see” as far down into the water column as light can penetrate. In most of the ocean, this is not very far – a few meters at best, as shown in the photo above. The average depth of the ocean, in contrast, is around 4 kilometers or 4000 meters.\nThe goal of this project was to develop a way of predicting sparsely sampled subsurface structure using higher resolution satellite data.\n\nPosters and Presentations\n\nGrossi, M.D., E.F.

    "text": "The motion of the ocean is chaotic, making it impossible to predict perfectly. This is especially true on time scales of hours to days and space scales less than 10 km. Oceanic motions on these scales are characterized as submesoscale and are strongly influenced by vertical motion. The ability to predict submesoscale motion is critical for forecasting the transport of material such as spilled oil, debris, or harmful algal blooms. Yet observing them is difficult because they are not detectable by the vast majority of satellite platforms circling the planet every day, and modeling them accurately with general ocean circulation models (OGCMs) or statistical models requires far finer grid resolution than is humanly or computationally possible. (To capture all ocean dynamics faithfully, one would need to calculate – or sample – velocity at an estimated 1023 spatial points simultaneously over many time steps, while the highest resolution OGCM on the largest state-of-the-art supercomputer calculates velocity at only 109 spatial points at any given time – and is extremely expensive to run.)\nModern data driven methods such as machine learning (ML) are built upon the rationale that cause and effect relationships often exist between relevant variables and observed outcomes. Any sailor or mariner, for example, is keenly aware of the relationship between wind speed and sea state. ML models “learn” statistical relationships between available data variables and then use that information to make predictions about new cases not seen during training, often with remarkable accuracy that exceeds human skill or traditional forecasting methods. And while training ML models requires considerable time and computational resources, once trained, they can easily be run in a matter of seconds or minutes.\nInspired by the success of ML in a multitude of other fields as well as its growing popularity in oceanography, this project explored whether observational ocean data, while sparse, contain enough information to train a ML model to predict surface transport. The project had several goals: first, determining the level of complexity of oceanic flows that simple ML algorithms – namely, artificial or feed-forward neural networks – could be trained to learn, and how their performance compared to more traditional statistical methods. This involved simulated and modeled particle trajectories. Next, we explored the degree to which these simple models could also learn to predict real observed trajectories using data from hundreds of surface drifters deployed in the northern Gulf of Mexico as part of the Grand Lagrangian Experiment in 2012. Finally, we considered whether more adanced ML models can improve predictive performance by incorporating physics-based intuition.\n\n Awards\n\nUniversity of Miami Center for Computational Science Graduate Fellow (supported cross-department interdisciplinary research; 2017)\nGulf of Mexico Research Institute (GoMRI) Scholar (also featured a project write-up by the funding agency; 2019)\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nGrossi, M.D., M.
