    "text": "Greetings!\nI am a data scientist with the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) having joined NOAA in 2021 after more than a decade in academia conducting and supporting oceanographic research. I oversee multidisciplinary teams of marine and computer scientists developing innovative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models for automating assorted SEFSC mission priorities including species identification and tracking, fish aging, and marine mammal detection from aerial drones.\nI also facilitate cloud migration, transition planning, and data curation and governance initiatives for the SEFSC and represent NOAA Fisheries in the NOAA Artificial Intelligence Working Group. As a strong proponent of FAIR data principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and open science, I serve on the SEFSC regional data governance team and participated in the 2024 NMFS OpenScapes Mentor program.\nMy first programming language is R, but nowadays I gravitate to Python due to its widespread popularity within the ML community. If a task seems automatable, I like to find a way. I prefer LaTeX over common word processing software any day. After years of using Jupyter Notebooks for writing Python code and documentating workflows, I was recently introduced to Quarto, which is quickly becoming my go-to publishing system.\n\n\n Technical Skills\n\n\n\n\n\n Python   Jupyter   R   RStudio \n\n\n MATLAB*   Docker   LaTeX   GitHub \n\n\n\nUNIX*\nMachine Learning\nQuarto*\n\n\n\n\n*Indicates working knowledge.
